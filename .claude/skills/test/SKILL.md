# Test

Read `doc/guides/test-guide.md` and follow it. Read the guide for the
language of this repo as well — `test-guide-dart.md` or
`test-guide-typescript.md` next to it — and apply whichever one matches
what the repo is written in.

## 1. Check the mirroring

List the source tree against the test tree and report every source file
without its own test file — coverage counts per file name.

## 2. Check the content

Report tests that assert element by element where a structural compare
belongs, printing in tests, mocks that a constructor parameter could
replace, and coverage ignores on paths that dependency injection could
reach.

## 3. Run the checks

Run the repo's own commit check and report what fails. Stop before
changing anything.

## 4. Report before fixing

List the findings first. Fix only what the user confirms.
