# Code Guide

What holds in every language we write. The rules that only make sense in
one of them live next door: [Dart](./code-guide-dart.md),
[TypeScript](./code-guide-typescript.md). For tests see the
[Test Guide](./test-guide.md).

## Lay out the package

- Name the package after the repo, and prefix its types with the same
  name
- Keep one top level concept per package
- Expose the package through a single entry point that re-exports and
  holds no implementation of its own
- Name a file after the main type it holds
- Mirror the source tree in the test tree one to one

## Open every file with the license header

- Copy the header from a neighbouring file
- Follow it with a blank line, then the imports

## Order the imports

- Runtime and standard library first, then third-party packages, then
  what belongs to this repo
- Sort each group alphabetically and separate the groups by a blank line

## Order the members of a type

- Constructors first, each with a doc comment
- Alternative constructors next
- Public methods, grouped by what belongs together, not alphabetically
- Public fields and getters, immutable by default
- Static constants and methods
- Private members last

Avoid mutability: change state through copy-with methods instead of
setters.

## Shape the API

- Use named parameters by default, positional only for a trivial single
  argument
- Give parameters sensible defaults
- Return a promise or future from async code and handle errors
  explicitly — never swallow them
- Await every asynchronous call, or mark deliberately that you do not

## Separate sections with comment landmarks

- A `#####` rule before a class, enum or other top level construct
- A `.....` rule before every documented method, getter or field block
- A named `#####` block inside a large type to mark a section

Keep the style as it is — do not invent variants.

## Document every public member

- Give each public member a doc comment
- Start with one complete sentence in third person indicative
- Document parameters on the following lines
- Add an example only when the call is not obvious

## Keep functions small and flat

- A function that outgrows roughly ten lines wants to be split — but only
  when the split is genuinely easier to read
- Return early instead of nesting; more than three levels of `if`, loop
  or `try` is a smell
- Give the extracted piece a name that says what it does, so the caller
  reads as prose

## Say it once

- Two nearly identical blocks are one block with a parameter
- Reuse the helper that already exists in the repo instead of writing a
  second one
- Duplicated imports, test setups and copied constants are the same
  problem in small

## Name things consistently

- Types in PascalCase, carrying the package prefix
- Private members marked the way the language marks them
- Constants and enum values in lowerCamelCase
- A test file named after the file it covers

## Avoid these

- A dynamically typed value where a real type fits
- Mutating public fields
- A TODO without a ticket reference
- Commented out code kept "for later" — git is the history
- A `Co-Authored-By` trailer in a commit
